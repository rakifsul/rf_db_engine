# rf_db_engine - Database Server Pack in One App

[README dengan Bahasa Indonesia Klik di Sini](https://github.com/rakifsul/rf_db_engine/blob/main/README_id.md)

## Intro

This application is capable of managing multiple types of database servers through a single main application.

Currently, there are three supported database servers:

- MariaDB
- PGSQL
- MongoDB

Specifically for MongoDB, it is not included directly in this package, so you need to click the "Install MongoDB" button first.

## Where to Download

Download the executables on "Releases" page.

## How to use

It is easy to use, as each server has 3 control buttons: Start, Stop, and Restart.
