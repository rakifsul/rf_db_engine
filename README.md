# rf_db_engine - Database Server Pack in One App

[README dengan Bahasa Indonesia Klik di Sini](https://github.com/rakifsul/rf_db_engine/blob/main/README_id.md)

This application is capable of managing multiple types of database servers through a single main application.

Currently, there are three supported database servers:

- MariaDB
- PGSQL
- MongoDB

Specifically for MongoDB, it is not included directly in this package, so you need to click the "Install MongoDB" button first.

It is easy to use, as each server has 3 control buttons: Start, Stop, and Restart.
